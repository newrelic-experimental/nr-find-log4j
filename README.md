Per [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) and [CVE-2021-45046](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046), Apache log4j2 versions < 2.16.0 (except 2.12.2) are vulnerable to remote code execution and potential data exfiltration.

This script will scan your New Relic account(s) for java services that *report* usage of log4j-core, and generate a manifest containing each suspect service with the version of log4j-core reported by New Relic APM.

Note that this script may generate false positives and false negatives. It is intended to assist your own investigation of potentially vulnerable systems, and does not provide any strong guarantees or proof of non-vulnerability.

## Usage

```sh
node nr-find-log4j.js
```

Requirements:

* Node.js (tested on versions 12 and 14)
* A New Relic **User** API Key

To get your New Relic API key, visit the
[New Relic API Key management page](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.launcher) 
and either copy an existing USER key (use the 'Copy key' action in the '...' menu)
or create a new key with the *Create a key* button.

Note: Even though user API keys are associated with an account, this script will be able to scan any account your user is authorized to access. You should not need to create an API key per account.

Executing this script will take some time if you have many java services.

Command-line options:

```sh
--csv           output findings in CSV format (default)
--json          output findings in JSON format
--all-services  include services that do NOT report presence of log4j-core
```

## Output

The output includes all Java services found to contain log4j-core, the vulnerable library.

Our suggested analysis is:

1. Check the version of log4j-core. Versions 2.0 through < 2.16.0 (except 2.12.2) are known vulnerable.
2. Verify you have upgraded the New Relic `agentVersion` to a known-safe [Java agent release](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/java-release-notes/).
3. Compare `examinedInstances` count on each service to the upgraded and mitigated instance counts to assess how many instances may still be vulnerable:
   1. `upgradedInstances` indicates how many running instances have log4j-core â‰¥ 2.16 or 2.12.2. If all instances are "upgraded" then we did not detect a vulnerable version of the library.
   2. `mitigatedInstances` indicates how many running instances have the `-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true` jvm argument applied.
4. Use the `nrUrl` link to directly examine the service's runtime environment as reported by the Java agent

The CSV and JSON files contain these fields:

* `accountId`           New Relic account id containing the service
* `applicationId`       New Relic application id of the service
* `name`                Display name of the service as seen in New Relic
* `examinedInstances`   Number of runtime instances of the service that were examined
* `upgradedInstances`   Number of examined instances that report using Log4j version 2.12.2 or 2.16+
* `mitigatedInstances`  Number of examined instances that report using the `-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true` JVM argument mitigation
* `agentVersion`        New Relic agent version detected in the service
* `log4jJar`            Name of the log4j-core jar file detected in the service
* `log4jJarVersion`     Version string of the log4j-core library detected in the service
* `log4jJarSha1`        SHA1 hash of the log4j-core jar file
* `log4jJarSha512`      SHA512 hash of the log4j-core jar file
* `nrUrl`               Link to the New Relic UI to examine the service's environment data

## Auditing New Relic Java agent usage

Per [Security Bulletin NR21-03](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/security/new-relic-security/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr21-03/), New Relic Java agent versions 7.4.2+ and 6.5.2+ contain updated Log4j2 libraries. To find out what version of the New Relic Java APM agent your services are running, use NRDB's `ApplicationAgentContext` events.

1. log into https://one.newrelic.com
2. click "Query your data" then select the "Query builder" tab
3. run this NRQL query against each of your accounts:

```nrql
SELECT latest(agent.version) FROM ApplicationAgentContext 
WHERE agent.language = 'java' AND agent.version NOT RLIKE r'([7-9]\.[4-9]\.|6\.[5-9]\.)[2-9]|[1-9]\d+'
SINCE 1 WEEK AGO FACET entity.guid, appName LIMIT MAX
```

The following query can also help gauge your percentage of agent reportings that resolve CVE-2021-44228:

```nrql
SELECT percentage(uniqueCount(agentHostname), WHERE apmAgentVersion RLIKE r'([7-9]\.[4-9]\.|6\.[5-9]\.)[2-9]|[1-9]\d+') AS 'Fixed Percentage', uniqueCount(agentHostname) as 'Total'
FROM NrDailyUsage 
WHERE apmLanguage = 'java'
FACET consumingAccountName
SINCE 1 DAY AGO LIMIT MAX
```

_This is [a daily sample](https://docs.newrelic.com/attribute-dictionary/?event=NrDailyUsage), therefore changes may take up to a day to reflect in this reporting._
